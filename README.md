This repository is intended to backup the Regional Internet Registries Statistics website for IP registration information, including what Autonomous System Number (ASN) an IP may belong to.

It is intended to run nightly.

## Information Location

The information came from [EU's RIR public stats](http://www-public.it-sudparis.eu/~maigron/RIR_Stats/index.html).

## What is possible with this data?

It is possible to use this data to identify [reverse lookup the location of the IP address](https://github.com/ipverse/rir-ip).
